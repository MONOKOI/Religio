## Physical Culture

### Postures

Sitting meditation
Walking meditation
Stretching Tai Chi, Yoga And Core Strength
Standing cooking and washing
Walking city life
Seated reading, writing and discussion
Walking and metro neighborhood transporation
Lying sleeping

### Food

We eat a low inflammation, longevity focused vegetarian (mammal free) homemade food diet.

Safety before fashion and fetish. 

Never imagine food safey is promised by hygeinic packaging. That is a commercial delusion. 

A safe diet is a homemade diet. 

Learning to cook the same dishes in small teams makes light work of eating well. Buying bulk for groups saves packaging waste. 

We do not drink alcholoh __WMH__.

### Oblutions

Bathe every day or two days.

Men shave face once or more per week.

Soak once per week in a few drops of anti-fungal tea tree oil.

Shave head for convenience and hygeine.

Keep nails neat and functionally short.
