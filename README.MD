# Religio

## How It Works

__Religio__ means *monastic way of life* very much like *Dhamma Vinaya* in Buddhism. 

__MONOKOI__ is a schematic __Religio__ with adaptive Quality Criteria (QC), Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), Risk Management Strategies (RM) And Tool Resources (TR) for *working and retirement cooperative single sex monasteries in safe walking urban neighborhoods featuring safe streets and public transportation*.
