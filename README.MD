# MONOKOI Monasteries

## Coop Living for Singles. Religious Orders.

__MONOKOI__ is the Greek plural of "monk," meaning "single person" or "unmarried person."

Religious orders are voluntary, cooperative and written living arrangements,  residential or otherwise, for single "monks."

Residential coops are "houses."

Using Christian terminology, coop house residents are "cenobites" and non-residents are "hermits."

## What Does "Monk" Have To Do With Sex? Nothing.

"Single" status concerns marital legal inheritance relationships, not sexual activities.

Monasteries don't permit conjugal guests, but monks might somehow enjoy consensual sexual relationships outside the monasteries.

## Who Makes Good Monks?

Anyone single, divorced, disabled, fired, lonely, stranded or otherwise disaffected with married life or solitary "dating" life.

## What Arrangements

## Inherently Plural

Religious orders are inherently plural and presumed compatible with one another under a larger umbrella organization providing shared support services.

Religious orders are akin to different gyms, each offering different machines, trainers, locations and schedules. 

Religious orders are akin to different restaurants, each offering different menues. 

## Written Sets of Rules

Monks organize themselves around written sets of rules, including written rules concerning how such sets of rules might be altered going forward.

The written sets of rules are not punitive. 

Rule sets are more like guarantees than restrictions. 

Rules are for groups of volunteers living together.

Volunteers "guarantee" the rules for each other, other monks also doing likewise.

## For Anyone, Not Everyone

Any given religious order aims for some suitability to nearly anyone, but not to everyone.

## Inter-Religious, Inter-Racial, Pacifying

## 4 Paths Up 1 Mountain

There are 4 paths up 1 mountain

- Pythagorean Philosophers
- Buddhist Monastics
- Christian Monastics
- Muslim Suffis

These 4 paths share important features

- Recruiting. Not ethno-nationalist.
- Portable. Not geography-bound.
- Written. Not oral.
- Publicized. Not secret.
- Large. Not small sects.
- Enduring. Not recent sects.

What Philosophers, Buddhists, Christians and Muslims can we accomodate? 

Monoxoi Philosophers are those kind happy for Monoxoi Buddhists. Monoxoi Muslims are happy for Monoxoi Christians. And so forth.

Shared written literacy is a prerequisite of all monoxoi monks.

## Peaceketeers

Nations states come and go. Friends become foes. Foes become friends. 

Monoxoi monks cannot subject the peaceful and intergenerational affairs of their their houses to such whimsies.

Monoxoi monks live as adopted families, no matter their mother tongues or countries of origin.

Monoxoi religious orders and houses are meant to endure even where nation states and regimes disappear.

## Pacify is a Verb

Monoxoi monks are not passive.

Monks are tamers of men needing taming.

## Skin Color

Monasteries are always mixed skin color and religious tradition. 


## Not Secret. Written. 

But the machines, trainers and menus are all written down. 

The shared routines and regimens of religious orders are not secret ones.

Religious orders aim to make their rules transparent and open to public scrutiny.

## What About Problems?

Monasteries are error correcting clubs against inevitable problems, obstacles and setbacks.

## Shared Intentions are Jobs

Intentions are businesses operated by monasteries.

Some monasteries come with "family business jobs."

Without spouses, children and recreational luxuries, monks are nearly always low cost service providers.

Monasteries aim for shorter work weeks and longer vacations than commercial jobs.


## Internal and External Charity

Internal charity means housing disabled, homeless, orphaned, elderly or otherwise disadvantaged monks.

External charity means operating charitable organizations based on donations.

## No TV, No Commuter Cars

40 monks won't agree on what to watch on TV. So we don't watch TV. Monks who want to watch TV can watch TV at local bars.

Monks share commercial vehicles where appropriate. Commercial vehicles pay for themselves.

Otherwise, monks do not own cars. Monks can rent cars when necessary. Money saved on cars is invested in new monasteries for more monks.

## Clean Houses. Great Food. 

Monks prepare great food everyday inside their orderly, decorative and clean houses. Monastic organizations minimize cleaning burdens and maximize food quality. Few or no Americans likely eat better lifelong diets than monks.

## Model IndoX Diet

Different orders feature compliant menues, but the model diet from which we spring variants is the following "Orthodox Christian Monastic" diet. NONE is always a good amount of fish/foul and meat. These menus are  guarantees of available options, not impositions. 

- 2 days lacto-octo vegetarian                              (fish, fowl, meat stocks permitted)
- 4 days lacto-octo vegetarian, fish/foul                   (fish, fowl, meat stocks permitted)
- 1 days lacto-octo vegetarian, fish/foul, meat.            (fish, fowl, meat stocks permitted)

Dishes and meals enjoy these qualities:

- Nutrient dense
- Biodiverse
- Bioavailable
- Pro/Pre-Biotic
- Allergy Sensitive
- Anti-Inflammatory
- Traditonal Preparations

Biodiversity 

- Herbs, Spices
- Legumes
- Seeds

Envision a homemade Indian, Indochinese or Indonesian restaurant with homemade curries, breads, cheeses, pickles and some foul and meat on sticks.

Then customize from there.

## Fasting

Monastic orders might or might not include fasting regimens, usually just daytime fasting, or extended fasting from fish, foul and meat.

Fasting is not punitive. Fasting excludes infants, sick, pregant and elderly. Fasting enhances immune system performance.

## Intoxicants

Monks drink beer, wine and mead they make themselves. Monks do not buy bottled beer, wine or mead for consumption within the houses.

Monks smoke marijuana they grow themselves.

Monks do not drink hard liquor in the houses. Monks do no use recreational opiate or amphetamine narcotics.

Monks confine hallucinagens to ritual uses.

NONE is always a great amount of intoxicants. But we don't waste money on cheap bottled intoxicants.

## Exercise

What is the best exercise regimen for lifelong mental acuity? Monks do not compete. Monks do not risk injury. Monk exercise concerns longevity, never sex-appeal. 

- Yoga 
- Tai chi
- Qigong
- Kalisthenics
- Massage
- Seated Meditations
- Walking Meditations
- Strolls and Hikes
- Self-Defense Training 

## Live Performing Arts, Retreat, Pilgrimage

Monks share classical music, jazz music, live theater, museum trip, author lectures, study group and ethnic-restaurant activities. 

Non-entertainment cultural costs are mostly low.

Retreats are trips to rustic outdoor locations.

Pilgrimages are trips to Eurasian holy sites.

## Study Groups

Monks within religios orders share comparative-religious, classical, historical and philosophical studies.

Monks also share practical managerial studies pertinent to their Family Businesses.

## Writing Groups

Monks write and edit articles on these studies and their relation to monastic lives.

We encourage monks to write and edit articles together instead of singularly.

## Clothing. Grooming.

Monks where some form of habit permitting more or less variations.

Monks are not secretly monks.

Monk clothing is comfortable, sturdy, weather appropriate, attractive, healthy and affordable.

Monk clothing does not display rank.

Some religious orders might use colors to attract attention to themseles.

Head and facial hair customs are specific to religious orders. 

Bathing is regular and therapeutic.

## 

## Finances? Minimize TCO. Buy Wholesale. Save, Invest, Expand.

TCO means Total Cost of Ownership. The TCO of owning a car is far greater than the retail price of the car.

Everything is like that. Even things people give us suffer costs of ownership.

Durable Goods last more than 3 years. 

A great guitar can last decades and even increase in value.

One pound of spearmint leaves costs far less per-ounce than 1/8 ounce of spearmint leaves.

Coops save money with tool sharing, service sharing and wholesale pricing and then invest those savings into expansion.

## Always Expanding and Recruiting

## MONOKOI

1. __MONO__ signifies single people. Such people may be divorced, in ill health or possibly traumatized. *MONOS* were singles and give us our word Monks today. There are several kinds of monks within Christendom explained elsewhere.
1. __KOI__ are fish that grow and live longer based on their care and feeing in *Koi Ponds.* MONOKOI is an exoteric framework for inter-religious combitable exploration of esoteric or hesychastic lives of roughly Orthodox Chrisian, Suffi Muslim or Theravada Buddhist lives of prayer, meditation, discernment and contemplation. Monks swim in schools like fish.

## Geometric Constraints

1. Cooperative efficient. We share duties, tools, space, demand, technique, accounting and knowledge. 
1. Working and Retirement. We run small businesses or work outside the house. We can support some retirees on social security payments with part time work. We live as together as early retirees. Our hobby is starting new MONOKOI houses.

1. Quiet. No drink, TV, radio or dates in the house. We schedule other programmatic events mostly optional.
1. Well fed. Homemade vegetarian (no mammals) food.
1. Monasteries. We live energy, utility and rent densely for ecological and budgetary reasons. 
1. Walking urban neighborhoods. We do not own cars. Cities provide almost infinite free high culture entertainment.
1. Safe streets. We can walk to get groceries we do not have delivered.
1. Public transportation. Public transportation gives access to city delights.

## Physical Culture

### Postures

Sitting meditation
Walking meditation
Stretching Tai Chi, Yoga And Core Strength
Standing cooking and washing
Walking city life
Seated reading, writing and discussion
Walking and metro neighborhood transporation
Lying sleeping

### Food

We eat a low inflammation, longevity focused vegetarian (mammal free) homemade food diet.

Safety before fashion and fetish. 

Never imagine food safey is promised by hygeinic packaging. That is a commercial delusion. 

A safe diet is a homemade diet. 

Learning to cook the same dishes in small teams makes light work of eating well. Buying bulk for groups saves packaging waste. 

We do not drink alcholoh __WMH__.

### Oblutions

Bathe every day or two days.

Men shave face once or more per week.

Soak once per week in a few drops of anti-fungal tea tree oil.

Shave head for convenience and hygeine.

Keep nails neat and functionally short.
